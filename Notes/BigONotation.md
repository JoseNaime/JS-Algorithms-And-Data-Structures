Help us to determine the code performance in *time complexity* and *space complexity*. Which 
makes it very important when discussing tradeoffs between different approaches
  
### The problem with time
Either, different and the same machine will record different times each run. 
A solution for this problem is that, rather than counting seconds (as they are variable), we can 
count the number of simple operations. Even though, counting each operation can be hard and long 
time-consuming.
